I created 2 functions that model the classic Monty Hall Game strategies of choosing switching your choice
or not switching your choice. 

I have 1 helper function that helps to shuffle th positioning of the 3 different "doors" before each game simulation. 

The 1st function models the no switching strategy and uses a for loop that simulates 1000 turns and an if statement nested in the for loop to test whether or not the player has won. 

The 2nd function models a switching strategy and uses a for loop that simulates 1000 turns, and 2 for loops nested in the 1st for loop that unveils a door, and models the player switching their choice, and then finally an if statement to check whether or not the player won.
